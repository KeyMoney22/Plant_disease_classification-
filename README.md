## Introduction
Tomatoes are one of the most important crops in Kenya, both economically and nutritionally. They are a staple in the diet of many Kenyans and a significant source of income for smallholder farmers. However, tomato production in Kenya faces numerous challenges, among which diseases are the most important. Tomato plants are susceptible to various diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and pests. These diseases can lead to substantial yield losses, reduced produce quality, and increased production costs due to the need for pesticides and other control measures.

The consequences of unchecked tomato diseases are severe. Yield losses can range from 20% to 100%, depending on the type and severity of the disease. This not only affects the income of farmers but also threatens food security and nutrition for millions of Kenyans. Addressing tomato diseases effectively is therefore crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity, improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, and ensuring food security in Kenya.

## Business Understanding

Agriculture is a cornerstone of Kenya's economy, with a majority of the population relying on it for their livelihood. However, plant diseases pose a significant threat to crop yields, leading to economic hardships for farmers and contributing to food insecurity. Traditional methods of disease detection are often slow, costly, and require expert knowledge.Developing an automated plant disease detection system using image recognition technology is crucial. This solution will enable Kenyan farmers to quickly and accurately identify diseases, take timely actions, and improve crop productivity, ultimately enhancing food security and supporting the country's agricultural economy.

### Objective

Develop an automated plant disease detection system leveraging image recognition technology. This solution aims to provide an accessible, cost-effective, and rapid method for farmers to diagnose plant diseases by analyzing images of crop leaves. By offering timely and accurate disease identification, this system can empower farmers to implement effective treatment strategies, minimize crop losses, and enhance agricultural productivity.

## Data Understanding

### Data Source

Our dataset was downloaded from a Kaggle repository authored by Plant Village.

PlantVillage is an organization hosted by Penn State University, is a research initiative focused on enhancing agricultural resilience and sustainability, particularly in the context of climate change. The platform employs advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and data analytics to address various agricultural challenges including plant disease, which will be the focus of this project.
For this project we shall focus on Tomato Leaves.

### Objectives
1. Dataset Development: Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset of plant leaf images from Kenyan farms, labeled with various disease types.
2. Model Development: Build and train a Deep Learning model to classify images of plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
4. Deployment: Develop a user-friendly mobile application that allows Kenyan farmers to upload images and receive disease diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
5. Impact Assessment: Evaluate the system’s impact on crop yield and farmer decision-making through pilot studies and feedback from Kenyan farmers.

### Metrics of success
1. Model Accuracy: Achieve a classification accuracy of over 90%.
2. Precision and Recall: Achieve precision and recall scores of over 85% for each disease category.
